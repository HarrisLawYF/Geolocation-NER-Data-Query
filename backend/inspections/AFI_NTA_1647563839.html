<p>Market commentary
</p>
<p>The S&amp;P/ASX 200 Accumulation Index closed 0.5 per cent lower in November, with global inflation concerns initially pushing the market 
lower, as the US consumer price index rose faster than expected and with the emergence of the Omicron covid variant toward the end  
of the month.  
</p>
<p>In this environment, Consumer Staples was one of the best performing sectors, up 4.5 per cent. Other sectors to perform strongly were 
Materials, up 6.3 per cent, on the back of a rise in commodity prices linked to the decarbonisation theme, Communication Services,  
up 5.2 per cent and Real Estate, up 4.3 per cent. 
</p>
<p>In contrast, the Energy sector fell 8.3 per cent, as the oil price fell during the period with the release of strategic oil reserves in the US and 
concern about the potential impact of the Omicron covid variant on economic growth.  The Banking sector was also down 9.3 per cent, 
driven largely by the fall in Westpac, which was down 20.1 per cent for the month.
