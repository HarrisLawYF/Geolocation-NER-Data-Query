<p>Market commentary
</p>
<p>The S&amp;P/ASX 200 Accumulation Index fell 6.4 per cent in January, the fourth worst start to the year since 1960. The global equity sell off was 
driven by rising real yields as the US Federal Reserve signalled an earlier start to quantitative tightening. The implication being rising yields 
are negative for equity valuations.
</p>
<p>Technology was the worst performing sector declining 18.4 per cent. Healthcare (down 12.1 per cent), Gold (down 11.8 per cent), Staples 
(down 9.6 per cent) and Real Estate (down 9.5 per cent) all suffered sharp falls while the Banking sector declined 5.7 per cent.
</p>
<p>Energy (up 7.9 per cent) was the best performing sector driven by double digit gains in oil and gas prices. Rising commodity prices also led 
to a gain in the Resources sector (up 3.0 per cent).
