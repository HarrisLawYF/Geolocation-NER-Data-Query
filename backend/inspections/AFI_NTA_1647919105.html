<p>Market commentary
</p>
<p>The Russian invasion of Ukraine influenced market movements for the month of February as investors moved into the Energy, Consumer 
Staples and Gold sectors. However, prior to the initiation of this conflict, the Technology sector came under pressure as underlying inflation 
continued to surprise in the US, lifting expectations for earlier than expected increase in interest rates. 
</p>
<p>Overall given the strength in selected sectors, the S&amp;P/ASX 200 Accumulation Index actually closed 2.1 per cent higher over February 
following the large fall in January 2022. 
</p>
<p>As mentioned, the strongest sectors in February were Energy, up 8.6 per cent, Consumer Staples, up 5.6 per cent, and Materials, which 
includes gold, was up 5.2 per cent. The Gold sector in its own right was up 18.5 per cent as investors fled to perceived safety  during the month. 
</p>
<p>In contrast, the Information Technology sector was down 6.6 per cent and Consumer Discretionary fell 5.0 per cent as many stocks with high 
valuations were re rated down in advance of expected increases in interest rates in the US.
