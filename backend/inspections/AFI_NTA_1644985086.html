<p>Market commentary
</p>
<p>The S&amp;P/ASX 200 Accumulation was down 1.9 per cent in September, delivering its first monthly loss in a year, as declining iron ore prices 
and investor concerns regarding the potential fallout from the Chinese property developer Evergrande weighed on the index. 
</p>
<p>Energy was the best performing sector, up 16.7 per cent, as oil prices reached  three year highs. Most other  sectors delivered negligible or 
negative returns with Materials stocks down the most, falling 9.3 per cent on an accumulation basis, as iron ore prices kept falling from highs 
at the beginning of the financial year. Other large falls were in Health Care, down 4.9 per cent over the month, Information Technology, down 
3.9 per cent and Consumer Staples, down 3.6 per cent.
